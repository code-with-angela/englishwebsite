## DESIGN
### Colour Scheme
I chose vibrant colours for this project to give the website energetic, welcoming and engaging feel.\
[Realtime Colors](https://www.realtimecolors.com/?colors=131610-FCFCFB-96c7e7-ee7ca2-eab55a&fonts=Poppins-Nunito%20Sans) website was used to generate color pallete as it provides instant realistic feel.

### Typography
Google Fonts was used to import the chosen fonts for use in the site.

**Nunito Sans** was chosen for body as it is a clean, modern sans-serif font that is easy to read on both desktop and mobile devices. Its rounded edges give it a friendly and approachable feel.

I chose to pair it with **Poppins** for headings - another sans-serif font that gives a slightly more structured feel due to its more geometric style.

### Imagery
All images used in this website are of my own creation using Canva.\
Other graphics are incorporated using [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/).

### Wireframes
The wireframes for mobile were created using Moqups web application.\
[Mobile wireframe](https://app.moqups.com/g5ID5qfnJA5NRQ334gz5yq1XnijMqEg8/view/page/ad64222d5)

### Features
This website is a single scrolling page with 5 separate page areas, that include about me section, services section, student reviews section, trial lesson request section and FAQs.

The website has a favicon in the browser tab.\
A sticky header on the page with a title that acts as a link to the top of the page and navbar to jump to different sections.\
A footer with copyright information, Privacy Policy Statement, Offer Agreement and contact me link.

#### Current limitations and future implementations
As the website is targeted for English learners, I want to provide a translated version in Ukrainian to make it more suitable for Ukrainian audience.

### Accessibility
This website is created with accessibility in mind from the very beginning: 
* The Realtime Colors website used to generate the color palette has inbuilt contrast checker to ensure readability. All colors chosen pass both AA and AAA levels.
* Both Nunito Sans and Poppins are considered accessible fonts for web design as they belong to sans-serif font family that is considered dyslexic-friendly. Aditionally, I ensured that these fonts are used with appropriate contrast, size, and spacing. 
* The code incorporates semantic HTML.
* Images have descriptive alt attributes.
* Icons without text have information for screen readers, such as social media icons, student profile, and menu.
* A hover state is used on all buttons on the site (N/A for mobile & tablet versions).
